## Problem
Given a linked list, swpa every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

* Your algorithm should use only constant extra space.
* You may **not** modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

## Examples
```
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
