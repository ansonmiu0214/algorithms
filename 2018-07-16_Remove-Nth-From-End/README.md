## Problem
Given a linked list, remove the `n`-th node from the end of list and return its head.

**Note:**
Given `n` will be always valid, could you do this in one pass?

## Example
```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```
