## Problem
Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers *without using multiplication, division and mod operator*.

Return the quotient after dividing `dividend` by `divisor`.

The integer division should truncate towrads zero.

## Examples
```
Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
```

```
Input: dividend = 7, divisor = -3
Output: -2
```

*Note:*

* Both dividend and divisor will be 32-bit signed integers.
* The divisor will never be 0.
* Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range.
