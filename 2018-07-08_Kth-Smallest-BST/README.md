## Problem
Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the `k`th smallest element in it.

Note: 
You may assume `k` is always valid, 1 ≤ `k` ≤ BST's total elements.

## Examples
```
**Input:** root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
**Output:** 1
```

```
**Input:** root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /
 1
**Output:** 3
```
