## Problem
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character `'.'`.

**Note:**
* A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
* Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
* The given board contain only digits `1-9` and the character `'.'`.
* The given board size is always `9x9`.

## Examples
```
Input:
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: true
```

Input:
[

  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],

  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

## Approach
Logical checking per row, column and sub-box.

Generalising the board to be of size nxn, the complexity analysis is as follow:
* O(n^2.5) running time complexity, since each cell is checked n^0.5 times and there are n^2 cells
* O(n^0.5) space complexity for the sets
